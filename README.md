This repository contains a simple sample app to show how to use Tag Commander's SDK in a Swift project.

The following steps have been taken in order to achieve that :

- Downloading the Core module and the SDK module from:

[our repository](https://github.com/TagCommander/pods)

follow the explanation on the same page about :

[Importing Frameworks](https://github.com/TagCommander/pods#framework)


The check in this demo the file 

[AppDelegate.swift : application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:](SwiftCommanders/AppDelegate.swift)

Nothing very impressive here, what we can see is a basic example on how to import the frameworks, ask the SDK to display debug information, instanciate TagCommander and add some data to send them directly.

Of course it is an example to show how it's possible and not a very good way to use our SDK. For that please read our complete documentation here :
